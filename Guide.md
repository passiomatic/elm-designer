# One minute guide 

At startup you will be presented with a blank page in the middle of the workspace. Start dragging elements from library (on lower left of the screen) into the page. Alternatively you can use the "Insert" dropdown button. 

In a typical page you will likely need:

### Headings

Mark the title and sub-sections of a page. Use them to make the content more scannable. 

### Paragraphs 

Chunk of text that will wrap if needed ([learn more][paragraph]).

### Buttons

Actionable items that trigger a functionality ([learn more][button])

## Text fields, checkboxes and radio selections

These will allow user to input text information, on/off values and predefined choices. ([learn more][input]).

### Rows and columns

A row will lay out children horizontally ([learn more][row]), while a column will lay out children vertically ([learn more][column]).

By default elements will be stacked vertically. In other words, each page itself is a column. 

### Images

Drop images from your file system into a container element (e.g. page, row, column, etc.), they will be automatically uploaded to the cloud and will remain available for 180 days. 

Once uploaded you can tweak the image dimensions specifying an exact pixel value or using the fit/fill strategy.

## Tweaking the design

You can tweak every element appearance using the panel on the right under the "Design" tab. 

## Code generation

Once you have done with the design you can export the Elm code by clicking the "Code" tab. By default Elm Designer generates the code for the actual selected element. 

By clicking on different elements you can copy code for the entire workspace, the current page or any other element.

## Using the outline view

The outline view on the upper left of the screen shows your document as a tree. From here you can rearrange, duplicate and delete elements.
